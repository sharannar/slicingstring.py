In this exercise, you will write a program that gets a substring (or slice) from a phrase entered by the user.

Open strings/Exercises/slicing.py.
Modify the main() function so that it:
Prompts the user to enter a phrase.
Tells the user what phrase they entered (e.g., Your phrase is 'Hello, World!').
Prompts the user for a start number.
Prompts the user for a end number.
Tells the user the substring (within single quotes) that starts with the start number and ends with the end number.
